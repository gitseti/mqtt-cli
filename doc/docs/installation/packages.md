# Installation using a package manager
*** 

## Homebrew
For **Mac OS X** and **Linux** systems use **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** to install MQTT CLI via the **[MQTT CLI Tap](https://github.com/hivemq/homebrew-mqtt-cli)**.
```
$ brew install hivemq/mqtt-cli/mqtt-cli
```


> **NOTE**: If you encounter an error like `Java 1.8+ is required to install this formula` please install a java version higher than 1.8. 
You can use `brew cask install adoptopenjdk` to install the latest release of adoptopenjdk.    

> **NOTE**: As latency-issues may slow down the CLI under **Mac OS X** please verify that you have the entry ``127.0.0.1 localhost your-pc-name`` specified under ``/etc/hosts``.
You can use ``sudo sh -c "echo 127.0.0.1 localhost $(hostname) >> /etc/hosts"`` to append this configuration to your hosts file.
